# PrestaShop

The package deploys the [PrestaShop](https://prestashop.com/) solution - an open-source, fully customizable e-commerce platform for selling products online. PrestaShop is effective, adapted to the growth of your business, fast, and easy to use, even for non-professionals.


## Environment Topology

This package creates a dedicated PrestaShop environment that contains one application server and one database container. It automatically deploys and sets the PrestaShop application. The automatic vertical scaling is enabled out of the box, and [horizontal scaling](https://www.virtuozzo.com/application-platform-docs/automatic-horizontal-scaling/) can be configured (if needed). The default software stacks utilized in the package are the following:

- Apache 2 PHP application server (PHP 8.1)
- MySQL 8 database
- PrestaShop 8.1.7
